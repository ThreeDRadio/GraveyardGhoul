Graveyard Ghoul
===============

Graveyard Ghoul runs Three D Radio graveyard timeslots.

It provides a continuous stream of music taken from Three D's music catalogue,
selected at random, but meeting Three D's play quotas.

Released under the MIT licence on the off chance someone else will find it
useful.
